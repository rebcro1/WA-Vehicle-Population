## Context
For this Achievement, I selected my own data to analyze, with the goal of conducting an
exploratory visual analysis in Python and finding connections between variables that seemed
worth exploring. The goals was after developing hypotheses, to use various advanced analytical
approaches to help test the hypotheses.

The results of the analyses has been presented in a Tableau dashboard/storyboard. Data
dashboards are an effective tool for, among other purposes, presenting data in an accessible
and tangible way. The dashboard tells the story of the analytical journey and, as such,
needs to contain a curation of the key results I discovered throughout this Achievement.

## Data
Source:  Contains information from [Electric Vehicle Population Size History By County](https://data.wa.gov/Transportation/Electric-Vehicle-Population-Size-History-By-County/3d5d-sdqb), which is made available here under the Open Database License (ODbL).

### Contents & Requirements
Dataset requirements were:
- Be open-source.
- Come from an authentic/authoritative source.
- Include non-anonymized column names.
- Be recent (ideally, no more than 3 years old.)
- Contain at least 2-3 continuous variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates,
years, etc).
- Contain at least 2-3 categorical variables (apart from index variables, ID variables, dates,
years etc).
- Contain at least 1,500 rows.
- Include a geographical object of some kind.
- In the course of the Achievement you will source a time series data set too.

## Limitations & Findings
Although the data selected met the criteria, the variables were already correlated to each other.  For example, total electric vehicles = battery-powered vehicles + plug-in hybrid vehicles; total vehicles = total electric vehicles + non-electric vehicles.  Exploratory analysis was completed, but did not allow support of a hypothesis that was not apparent, i.e. _"the number of battery-powered vehicles increases the total number of electric vehicles"_

What I was able to discern is that electric vehicles are **_replacing_** non-electric vehicles, not just adding to the total number of vehicles registered in the state of Washington.
